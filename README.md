# DIF Open Group Repo Template

## About
Use this if you need a repository for DIF User Groups and Special Interest Groups, collectively referred to as Open Groups (OGs). It contains the group's common files (such as license and contributing instructions) in the `main` branch

## Template Instructions
- Create your new repo from this template ("Use this template")
- `main` branch changes:
    - Add chair github handles in the [CODEOWNERS](./CODEOWNERS) file.
    - Update links in AGENDA.md and [set up hackmd integration](https://hackmd.io/s/link-with-github)
    - Update this README.md (see example content below)

After committing these changes, you should see the group landing page at identity.foundation/[repo name]
