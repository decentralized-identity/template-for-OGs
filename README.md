# DIF Open Group Repo Template

## About
Use this repository template for DIF User Groups and Special Interest Groups, collectively referred to as Open Groups (OGs). It does the following:
- Contains the group's common files (such as license and contributing instructions) in the `main` branch
- Hosts the group's landing page in the `gh-pages` branch

## Template Instructions
- Find/replace "template-for-OGs" with group name
- `main` branch changes:
    - Update this README.md (see example content below)
    - Add the approved group charter (in markdown format) as charter.md
    - Add chair github handles in the [CODEOWNERS](./CODEOWNERS) file.
    - Update links in AGENDA.md and [set up hackmd integration](https://hackmd.io/s/link-with-github)
- `gh-pages` branch:
    - In package.json, update group `name`, `homepage`, and `repository.url` 
    - Add group images into `docs/images/`. This includes photos of chairs and the group images.
    - Update docs/index.html with relevant group information
- Configure github repo, for example  (TODO: this section needs review and clarification)
    - Update all of the links in AGENDA.md and [set up hackmd integration](https://hackmd.io/c/tutorials/%2Fs%2Flink-with-github)
    - Check repo tags
    - Check gh-pages (double-check that Settings > Pages is configured correctly)

After committing these changes, you should see the group landing page at identity.foundation/[repo name]
